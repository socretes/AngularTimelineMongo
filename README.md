AngularTimelineMongo
====================

This is a demonstration of how to quickly create a single page application with a RESTful API (ServiceStack) and Document database (MongoDB).

This started off as an investigation into Angular and MongoDB but I've been pretty impressed by ServiceStack.

The application is very simple but hopefully is a clean starting point

Any feedback as to how I've used any of Angular, ServiceStack and MongoDB would be much appreciated.

Some outstanding issues:

Jon: hook up validation, logon (WIP - see AngularTimeLineMongoJD branch)

No tests (shame on me)

Don, Gary: Angular/ServiceStack for Events and timelines

Andy: search

Reyaz: Publish to twitter
